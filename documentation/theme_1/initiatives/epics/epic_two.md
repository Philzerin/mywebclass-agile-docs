# Epic #2: CI/CD Continuous Integration

# Description: 
This epic focuses on integrating a continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline for MyWebClass.org to streamline the deployment process and improve the efficiency of development efforts.

# Goals:

1. Automate the build, testing, and deployment process for the MyWebClass.org web application
2. Improve code quality by running automated tests on every code change
3. Enable more frequent releases to production by reducing the time and effort required to deploy new code
4. Increase collaboration and visibility among development team members
# User Stories:

1. As a developer, I want to set up a CI/CD pipeline so that code changes can be automatically built, tested, and deployed to production.
2. As a QA tester, I want to have automated tests run on every code change so that I can identify and report issues more quickly.
3. As a project manager, I want to be able to track the progress of code changes through the CI/CD pipeline so that I can better plan for releases and deployments.

# Dependencies:

1. Availability of appropriate tools and infrastructure for CI/CD integration.
2. Integration with source code management system (e.g., Git) and project management tools (e.g., Jira).
3. Availability of necessary resources (e.g., personnel, time) for implementation.
# Risks:

1. Potential disruption of development workflow during implementation.
2. Complexity of integrating the CI/CD pipeline with existing infrastructure and systems.
3. Potential for errors and delays during deployment.
 - Mitigation Strategies:

1. Careful planning and communication with all team members.
2. Thorough testing and documentation of the CI/CD pipeline.

# Estimated Effort: 2 weeks

# Business Value:

1. Improved efficiency and productivity of development efforts
2. Higher quality code with fewer defects and issues
3. Faster and more frequent releases to production
4. Improved collaboration and visibility among development team members
# Priority: High
