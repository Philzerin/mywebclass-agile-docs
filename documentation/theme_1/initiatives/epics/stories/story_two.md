"As a developer, I want to integrate CI/CD pipelines into the project to automate the build, testing, and deployment process."

# Acceptance Criteria:

1. The pipeline must automatically build the codebase from source control whenever changes are pushed.
2. The pipeline must run a comprehensive suite of automated tests on the built code.
3. The pipeline must generate and publish reports of the test results.
4. The pipeline must automatically deploy the built and tested code to a staging environment.
5. The pipeline must allow manual triggering of deployment to production.
6. The pipeline must be configurable and allow for easy modifications to the build, test, and deployment process.
