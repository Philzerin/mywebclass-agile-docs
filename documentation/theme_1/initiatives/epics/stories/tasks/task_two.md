# Task Title: Implement CI Pipeline

# User Story: 
As a developer, I want to have a Continuous Integration pipeline set up for my code repository, so that I can ensure that my code builds and tests pass automatically.

# Description: 
This task involves setting up a CI pipeline using a CI/CD tool such as Jenkins or Travis CI. 
## The pipeline should include the following stages: 
clone repository, build code, run tests, and generate reports. 

# The acceptance criteria for this task are:

1. The pipeline should be triggered automatically whenever changes are pushed to the repository.
2. The pipeline should report the status of each stage and notify the developer of any failures.
3. The pipeline should generate test reports and code coverage reports.
# Dependencies:

1. Availability of a CI/CD tools.
2. The repository should be hosted on a platform that supports webhooks for triggering the pipeline.
