# CI/CD Continuous Integration

# Description: 
This initiative aims to implement Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) practices for the MyWebClass.org project. CI/CD is a set of best practices that automate the process of building, testing, and deploying code changes, ensuring that the code is always in a releasable state.

# Goals:

1. To ensure that code changes are regularly integrated and tested.
2. To automate the process of building, testing, and deploying code changes.
3. To reduce the time between code changes and deployment to production.
4. To improve the reliability and stability of the production environment.

# Scope:
This initiative will cover the implementation of CI/CD practices for the backend and frontend of the MyWebClass.org project.

# Outcomes:

1. Reduced time to deploy code changes to production.
2. Increased reliability and stability of the production environment.
3. Improved collaboration and communication among team members.
4. Reduced time spent on manual testing and deployment tasks.

# Deliverables:

1. Automated build and deployment pipelines for the backend and frontend.
2. Automated testing suites for the backend and frontend.
3. Documentation on the CI/CD practices and procedures.
# Milestones:

1. Research and planning: 1 week
2. Setup of the CI/CD infrastructure: 3 weeks
3. Integration of the build and deployment pipelines: 3 weeks
4. Implementation of automated testing: 3 weeks
5. Documentation and training: 1 week
# Constraints:

1. Limited resources for the setup and maintenance of the CI/CD infrastructure.
2. The need for coordination with the development and operations teams.
# Assumptions:

1. The development team will adopt best practices for writing automated tests.
2. The operations team will provide the necessary infrastructure resources for the setup and maintenance of the CI/CD system.
3. The development team will be able to collaborate and communicate effectively to ensure the success of the initiative.
# Risks:

Resistance to change among team members.
 - Mitigation: Regular communication and training to ensure understanding and buy-in from team members.
Lack of experience in implementing CI/CD practices.
 - Mitigation: Collaboration with experienced DevOps students and continuous learning and improvement.
# Dependencies:

1. Adherence to best practices for writing automated tests by the development team.
2. Coordination and communication among team members to ensure the success of the initiative.
