# Theme 1.0: Project Setup
## Overview
Our goal at MyWebClass.org is to establish a strong and highly visible web presence using lean and agile principles. 
Our objective is to quickly and effectively develop a foundation that supports our business requirements, setting us 
up for long-term success. By implementing the initiatives outlined in this theme, we can ensure that our website 
meets our goals and objectives throughout the life of the project. This will help us to establish a solid foundation 
for MyWebClass.org, providing a platform for us to build on as we continue to grow and evolve. Our focus on lean and 
agile principles will enable us to adapt quickly to changing circumstances and ensure that our website remains 
relevant and effective in the rapidly changing online landscape.
